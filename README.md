# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
Every year many deaths are caused due to brain stroke. Early prediction of whether a patient
would get a stroke or not can be very useful in taking early precautions and help save many lives.
The main objective of our project is to develop ML models that will help in predicting if the
patient is likely to have a brain stroke or not based on features related to the patient. The dataset
that is obtained from Kaggle was split into the training set, validation set and test set. We used
five supervised learning algorithms - Logistic regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks
(Multi-Layer Perceptron), Adaboost and Naive Bayes, to train our models. Then we assessed
their performance on the validation set to figure out which of them was performing better and we
used our top performers on the test dataset. But the significant challenge here is imbalanced data
where the number of samples that are non-stroke is very high in the dataset. To overcome this
problem, we did oversampling with a technique called smote.
